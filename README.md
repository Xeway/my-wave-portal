# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

This project is an introduction to web3 by buildspace, here's the course link : https://buildspace.so/
Personnal opinion : this is a very good course, you learn a lot, it's very well guided but not too much, you have to make so little task on your own. But it's very accessible : you have to use React, never touched it, and I managed to get by not too badly. Here is my final project : https://replit.com/@Xeway/waveportal-starter-project
